# What is Genestack?

Genestack is a complete operations and deployment ecosystem for Kubernetes and OpenStack. The purpose of
this project is to allow hobbyists, operators, and cloud service providers the ability to build, scale, and
leverage Open-Infrastructure in new and exciting ways.

Genestack’s inner workings are a blend of dark magic — crafted with [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) and
[Helm](https://helm.sh). It’s like cooking with cloud. Want to spice things up? Tweak the
`kustomization.yaml` files or add those extra 'toppings' using Helm's style overrides. However, the
platform is ready to go with batteries included.

Genestack is making use of some homegrown solutions, community operators, and OpenStack-Helm. Everything
in Genestack comes together to form cloud in a new and exciting way; all built with opensource solutions
to manage cloud infrastructure in the way you need it.
